# FcmDigitalTask

I updated a little bit my previous solution.
This time I used NimbleParser to parse segments of the reservation because I read recently about it and I wanted to try it.
I added error handling when given input data is incorrect, assuming that all segments need to be parsed correctly for the reservation to be valid
